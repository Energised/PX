## Notes to Self

- Clean up the display for the board
    - Redesign the flexbox to give board more space
    - Align image to side
    - Add a bar to the bottom for buttons, entering a custom board size
    - Add a score counter for how many you've solved

- More functionality for the player
    - Add a right click function to create a hint highlight
    - Let user build and design their own puzzle
    - Find some good way of saying it - an API with some basic DB functionality

- Generate a way to detect the win condition
    - Add a little animation and message when the user has completed it
    - Add a regenerate picross puzzle button
    - Loop will start all over again
